# Visualising Search Algorithms

## Summary

This is a Java based tool that can be used by students/teachers to help understand the proccesses of various pathfinding/search algortihms. It is a GUI application that features an interactive 2D grid where the user can place nodes and run different search algorithms on it. It will be made into an exectuable file to be run from any desktop with Java installed.

## Features


- Interactive 2D grid
- Ability to place start nodes, goal nodes, wall nodes, swamp nodes
- Ability to perform a variety of algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A*, Random Walk
- Ability to save and retrieve pre-made maps
- Ability to control the speed the algorithms operate at
- Dynamic colour alterations of nodes
